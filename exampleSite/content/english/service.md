  title: Challenges To Consistency In Immunogenomic Data Management And Analysis

    name: Variation in Typing Methodology
    content: The large variety of typing methods in use results in datasets being
      generated with varying levels of resolution, so that a particular allele (or
      set of equivalent alleles) may be identified in a sample using one method, while
      a slightly different allele (or set of equivalent alleles) may be identified
      in the same sample, using a different method.
  - icon: ''
    name: Changes in Nomenclature
    content: The continual evolution of the nomenclature conventions over time has
      resulted in a progression of allele and locus identifiers that are not always
      easily inter-related. It is usually the case that the nomenclature used to identify
      the alleles in a dataset is "frozen" at the time when that dataset is generated
      and published, which can make comparisons with datasets generated under successive
      nomenclature conventions difficult.
  - icon: ''
    name: Variation in Data Management Standards
    content: The lack of clear standards with regard to the manner in which immunogenetic
      data are recorded and stored often makes it difficult to integrate datasets
      for meta-analyses, or to even share data between research groups. This becomes
      especially problematic with very large datasets, as the process of reformatting
      data is often accomplished by hand.
  - icon: ''
    name: Variation in Ambiguity Reduction Methods
    content: When polymorphisms that distinguish alleles are not assessed (e.g., because
      they are in an exon that is not interrogated by the typing method employed),
      the result is allelic ambiguity, where exact identity of one or both of the
      alleles present in a given sample at a given locus cannot be known. When it
      is not possible to establish phase between key polymorphisms common to many
      alleles, the result is genotypic ambiguity, where multiple genotypes are possible
      for a given sample. The choice of one allele over another, or of one genotype
      over another, is the process of ambiguity reduction. Currently, there is no
      standard method for reducing these ambiguities, and different research groups
      may apply different methods to the same set of ambiguities, resulting in different
      alleles and genotypes being chosen for the same typing result.

    name: High Polymorphism
    content: The high level of polymorphism associated with these genetic systems
      presents particular bioinformatic, statistical and computational challenges
      that have yet to be addressed in a standardized manner. For example, haplotype
      estimation, case-control association studies and test of fit to HWE are all
      subject to biases introduced by large numbers of low-frequency alleles (aka,
      sparse cells). Guidelines based on theoretical and empirical considerations
      are required for each method in order to insure consistency in the application
      and interpretation of these analyses.
